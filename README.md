# INT 1.2

This project main purpose is to create a webapp that will display all of your graded and ungraded assignments from GradeScope. 

In my opinion, GradeScope is a great tool but when it comes to checking for missing assignments it becomes very tedious.

# Technologies

* I will be using a Python Script that I built to webscrape the GradeScope website
* For the data formating I will be using HTML and CSS
* For handling data and adding the Google Calendar functionality I will use JavaScript
